## 👩‍💻 About Me


Hi, I’m Sarah  
I’m an AI / GenAI Engineer focused on designing, evaluating, and operationalizing LLM-powered systems that are reliable, testable, and production-ready.

I approach prompt engineering as an engineering discipline, not trial-and-error. My work emphasizes structured prompt design, evaluation loops, and safety guardrails—treating LLMs as components in systems rather than standalone black boxes. I enjoy bridging human intent and machine execution by translating complex requirements into clear, constrained, and testable instructions.


**🧠 What I Specialize In**

Prompt engineering using Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, and ReAct techniques

Prompt optimization to reduce hallucinations and improve reasoning consistency

LLM evaluation & benchmarking across models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude)

Guardrails, fallback logic, and responsible AI constraints

Python-based prompt pipelines, validation, and analysis

Production-oriented GenAI workflows, documentation, and reproducibility

**📌 Featured Work**
📄 Prompt Engineering Case Study (PDF + GitHub)

A 7-page case study demonstrating how structured prompt design, evaluation frameworks, and guardrails improved LLM reliability and reduced hallucinations by 30–40%.

This project reflects the type of work I’m most passionate about: building safe, dependable, and scalable GenAI systems.
