## 👩‍💻 About Me


I’m an Entry-Level AI & Python Developer with a strong focus on Machine Learning and Data Science, passionate about building data-driven solutions that solve real-world business problems.

I work on end-to-end machine learning projects—from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation. My recent projects include Customer Churn Prediction and Credit Card Fraud Detection, where I worked with real, highly imbalanced datasets and focused on production-relevant evaluation metrics.

I enjoy uncovering patterns in data, building predictive models, and translating technical results into actionable insights. Through hands-on projects, I’ve strengthened my skills in Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
