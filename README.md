## 👩‍💻 About Me


I’m an AI Prompt Engineer / AI Engineer focused on designing, evaluating, and optimizing prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce reliable, accurate, and production-ready outputs.

My work centers on prompt architecture, chain-of-thought reasoning, evaluation loops, and safety guardrails—treating prompt engineering as an engineering discipline rather than trial-and-error. I enjoy bridging human intent and machine execution by translating complex requirements into structured, testable LLM instructions.

What I specialize in:

• Prompt engineering using Few-Shot, Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, and ReAct techniques
• Prompt optimization to reduce hallucinations and improve reasoning consistency
• LLM evaluation & benchmarking across models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude)
• Guardrails, fallback logic, and responsible AI constraints
• Python-based prompt pipelines, validation, and analysis
• Production-oriented GenAI workflows and documentation

Recently, I created a 7-page Prompt Engineering Case Study demonstrating how structured prompt design, evaluation, and guardrails improved LLM reliability and reduced hallucinations by 30–40%. This project reflects the type of work I’m passionate about: building safe, dependable, and scalable AI systems.

I also bring a strong foundation in Python, machine learning, NLP, and data analysis, which helps me collaborate effectively with engineers and reason about AI systems beyond prompts alone.
